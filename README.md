This is the code base for creating Maven artifact for TestZeus. You can add it from Maven as below : 
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.testzeus</groupId>
  <artifactId>Test_Zeus</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

Please use the most updated version from Maven Central. 
The URL is as follows: 
https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.testzeus/Test_Zeus

OR K.I.S.S (Keep It Simple Silly) and download the JAR. 

For the super passionate ones, who would like to build from source : 
```
mvn clean package
```

Note : I would like to credit great coffee and good music (turntablism) to help me get through the Sonatype upload process. 🤗
